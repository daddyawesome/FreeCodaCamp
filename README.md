## This should be my Repo for my studies using FreeCodeCamp

## My RoadMap

1. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification (300 hours)
2. Learn Python Programming from Scratch*

**Python notes for beginners**

- Data Preparation
- Statistics
    - Descriptive/Summary statistics
        How to summarise a sample of data
        Different types of distributions
        Skewness, kurtosis, central tendency (e.g. mean, median, mode)
        Measures of dependence, and relationships between variables such as correlation and covariance
    - Experiment design
        Hypothesis testing
        Sampling
        Significance tests
        Randomness
        Probability
        Confidence intervals and two-sample inference
    - Machine learning
        Inference about slope
        Linear and non linear regression
        Classification
    - Statsmodels
    
        Resources: I am a big fan of the statistics course on [Khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) for learning the basics. The [SciPy             lecture notes](https://www.scipy-lectures.org/packages/statistics/index.html) are another great resource to learn these concepts in Python. I also highly                 recommend reading the book [Think Stats](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkstats/) â€” available for free online.
- Calculus
    - Derivatives
        Geometric definition
        Calculating the derivative of a function
        Nonlinear functions
    - Chain rule
        Composite functions
        Composite function derivatives
        Multiple functions
    - Gradients
        Partial derivatives
        Directional derivatives
        Integrals
        
        Resources: One of the best resources I have come across to learn these principles is this 
                    [machine learning cheatsheet](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/calculus.html#gradients) which also covers linear algebra, regression,                       and the maths behind neural networks. I also really love this 
                    [blog post](https://betterexplained.com/articles/a-gentle-introduction-to-learning-calculus/) that provides a gentle introduction to calculus with                       practical examples.
- Linear Algebra
    - Vectors and spaces
        Vectors
        Linear combinations
        Linear dependence and independence
        Vector dot and cross products
    - Matrix transformations
        Functions and linear transformations
        Matrix multiplication
        Inverse functions
        Transpose of a matrix
                Resources: This [blog post](https://www.ritchieng.com/linear-algebra-machine-learning/) by Ritchie Ng covers matrices and vectors really well. If you                                 want a more in depth overview of the field this is a good [free book](http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/book.pdf) that gives an extensive                             coverage of linear algebra.
